**Master's Thesis Literature Review**

This repository contains critical reviews of scientific papers focusing on the mathematical and statistical aspects of vector-borne disease modeling for my master's thesis literature review.

**About**

This collection provides in-depth mathematical and statistical critiques of key papers in vector-borne disease modeling. Each review emphasizes:

Mathematical model formulation and assumptions
Statistical methodology and parameter estimation
Mathematical consistency and rigor
Identification of inconsistencies or methodological issues

**Review Focus**

Each review critically examines:

Model Formulation: Correctness of differential equations, difference equations, or other mathematical structures

(Parameter Estimation: Statistical methods used and their appropriateness)
Mathematical Assumptions: Validity and biological plausibility

Analytical Solutions: Correctness of derivations (equilibria, stability analysis, reproduction numbers)

(Numerical Methods: Implementation and validation)
(Statistical Analysis: Data fitting, uncertainty quantification, sensitivity analysis)

Identified Inconsistencies: Mathematical errors, statistical issues, or logical gaps
